Create a backend for e-commerce store.
It should have these endpoints:

    GET     /categories
    POST    /categories             {"description": "foo", "name": "bar"}
    GET     /categories/{id}
    PUT     /categories/{id}        {"description": "baz", "name": "biz"}
    DELETE  /categories/{id}

    GET     /products
    POST    /products             {"description": "foo", "name": "bar", "price" 10.2, "category": 3}
    GET     /products/{id}
    PUT     /products/{id}        {"description": "baz", "name": "biz", "price" 10.2, "category": 3}
    DELETE  /products/{id}

Category entity will have 2 fields:
name (string)
description (string)

Product will have 4 fields:
name (string)
description (string)
price (float)
category (int) - this should point to a ID in "categories" database.


Bonus task:

create endpoint:
    GET /categories/{id}/products, that woud return list of all the products for this category.
For example if we have a category with index 1 and we we have 10 products, 3 of witch have the "category" feild with value 1,
this endpoint would return list of those 3 products like this:
[
    {"description": "foo 1", "name": "bar 1", "price" 10.2, "category": 1},
    {"description": "foo 2", "name": "bar 2", "price" 10.2, "category": 1},
    {"description": "foo 3", "name": "bar 3", "price" 10.2, "category": 1}
]
